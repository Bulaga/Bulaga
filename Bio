- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bulaga, 27 years old and have fully commited my time to learning code.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the skills required to become a junior developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java script algorithm's and data structures, with intention to expand my knowledge into other languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects that help me and others reach our individual goals.
- 🌱 My current goal is to finish the course i have started in Java Script then pivot towards learning the skills
        required to create a restaurant menu in code. I have been a chef for many years and have written out upwards
        of 8 restaurant menus. I would like to use that knowledge and pair it with writing code to work on a fun project while
        learning a new skill.
- 🌱 My Main goal is to become a junior software developer in the next 14-18 months. 
- 📫 How to reach me BulagaCody@gmail.com

HAPPY CODING
